# gProcessor
A hypothetical and unrealistic idea of a 6502-like microprocessor

### The Emulator
It emulates how gProcessor would actually run, shocking right

### The Assembler
#### Ze Simple
Does stuff, `asm <=> bin` it is easy to convert assembly to bytecode and back.

#### Ze Advanced
Advanced version does not exist, it would be more readable than the simple one though.
